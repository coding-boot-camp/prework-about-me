    <h2>About Scorpions</h2>
    <p>
        This German hard rock band was formed at school in 1965 by guitarist Rudolf Schenker (31 August 1948, Savstedt,
        Germany). With younger brother Michael Schenker (b. 10 January 1955, Savstedt, Germany; guitar), Klaus Meine (b.
        25 May 1948, Hannover, Germany; vocals), Lothar Heimberg (bass) and Wolfgang Dziony (drums), they exploded onto
        the international heavy rock scene with Lonesome Crow in 1972. This tough and exciting record was characterized
        by Schenker’s distinctive, fiery guitar work on his Gibson ‘Flying V’ and Klaus Meine’s dramatic vocals. Prior
        to recording their major label debut for RCA Records, Heimberg, Dziony and Michael Schenker left, the latter
        joining UFO. Uli Jon Roth, Francis Buchholz and Jürgen Rosenthal stepped in on guitar, bass and drums
        respectively, for the recording of 1974’s Fly To The Rainbow. Rudy Lenners took over as drummer from Rosenthal
        the following year. The following releases, In Trance and Virgin Killer, epitomized Scorpions’ new-found
        confidence and unique style - a fusion of intimidating power-riffs, wailing guitar solos and melodic vocal
        lines. Produced by Dieter Dierks, the improvements musically were now matched technically. The band’s reputation
        began to grow throughout Europe and the Far East, backed up by exhaustive touring. 1977’s Taken By Force saw
        Herman Rarebell (b. 18 November 1949) replace Lenners, with the band branching out into power ballads, bolstered
        by emotive production, for the first time. Although commercially successful, Roth was not happy with this move,
        and he quit to form Electric Sun following a major tour to support the album. Tokyo Tapes was recorded on this
        tour and marked the end of the first phase of the band’s career. This was a live set featuring renditions of
        their strongest numbers.
