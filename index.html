      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm a UI/UX Designer looking to extend my skillset to front-end development.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Roseville, CA</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Playing boardgames with family and my girlfriend.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>To be Chief Creative Officer of my app Wribbn that I co-founded. We've raised 1M dollars and it's my hope that we secure more funding to grow the app's customer base and feature offerings.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>East Sacramento</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Front-end is already integrated in my current job. But my understanding ends with HTML/SCSS and mild jQuery. I want to grow in this space to better communicate with engineers and have my product design move from static HTML to working web apps.</p>
