      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Equal opportunity animal lover, amature cocktail artist, prone to word associating obscure movie qoutes and song lyrics into common interactions. </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>The Norgate neighborhood of Seattle... just a few blocks away from Haller Lake and what used to be Northwest Hospital.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Target shooting, axe throwing, repeatedly playing the 'Careless Whisper' rift on my tenor saxophone, making/drinking cocktails, hiking with my dog and girlfriend.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>One where I can get absorbed in the work, where I can create things, and am allowed to exercise my dry sense of humor.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>In Shoreline, recently moved back to the Seattle area from Southern Indiana after a 9-year hiatus. It's gotten way too expensive -I mean, *a lot has changed*....</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Because it's a technical job where I can be creative, where I can see the work take shape into something tangible, and because it's a high demmand job which will remain professionally relevant for years to come.</p>
