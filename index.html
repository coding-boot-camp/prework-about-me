      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Equal opportunity animal lover, amature cocktail artist, prone to word associating obscure movie qoutes and song lyrics into common interactions. </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>The Northgate area of Seattle.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Playing the 'Careless Whisper' rift on my saxophone (aka the only thing I can remember how to play these days), hanging out with my dog, making cocktails while enjoying good music and company.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>One where the work is engaging, I can be creative, and I'm allowed to exercise my dry sense of humor.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>In Shoreline, recently moved back to the Seattle area from Southern Indiana after a 9-year hiatus. The cost of living has gone up...</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Because it's a technical job and in high demmand. As far as I can tell, the elements of a dream job are there if I can find the right organization to work for.</p>
