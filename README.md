## About Me 
I am currently in full stack developer bootcamp. I am always looking for an opportunity to code, design and learn. Before coding, I was in the health care field for over 20 years. I learned a lot about planning and keeping things simple, something I now practice with everything that I do in life. In my spare time I try to build and learn new coding skills. I am bilingual. I enjoy watching movies and traveling.
