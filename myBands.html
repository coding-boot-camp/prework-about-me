							Suede (known in the United States as The London Suede) are an English rock band formed in London in 1989. The band is composed of singer Brett Anderson, guitarist Richard Oakes, bass player Mat Osman, drummer Simon Gilbert and keyboardist/rhythm guitarist Neil Codling.

							In 1992, Suede were dubbed by Melody Maker as "The Best New Band in Britain",[1] and attracted much attention from the British music press. The following year their debut album Suede went to the top of the UK Albums Chart, becoming the fastest-selling debut album in almost ten years. It won the Mercury Music Prize and helped foster 'Britpop' as a musical movement, though the band distanced themselves from the term. The recording sessions for their second album, Dog Man Star, were fraught with difficulty and ended with original guitarist Bernard Butler departing after confrontations with the other members. The album was completed without Butler, and the band toured the record with replacement Richard Oakes. Although a commercial disappointment at the time, the album was met with a generally enthusiastic reception on release and has over time been lauded with universal acclaim from critics.[2][3] In 1994, Suede would become a component of the Britpop "big four", along with Oasis, Blur and Pulp.[4]
